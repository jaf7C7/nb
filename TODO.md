* Revisit syntax
* Interactive selection of notes instead of copy/pasting the ID
* Allow pushing to a server which serves notes rendered as HTML
* Ideally would be able to use the github API to search through the files in the
  repo and curl the desired file, if no repo was available locally (e.g. `--sparse`)
